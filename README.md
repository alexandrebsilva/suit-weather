# Suit-weather

This App was designed for educational purposes. Challenging myself over mobile development
## Installation

npm install
```

Make sure you have expo globally installed 

if you don't have it installed , follow the steps according to the original [docs](https://docs.expo.io/)



## Usage

Create an account on [HG-BRasil](https://hgbrasil.com/status/weather) and create an api key 

Create and set the api key on a new file .env, based on [.env-example](/.env-example)

This will serve a expo server and then you can check the app on your phone or any emulator
